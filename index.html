          <div>I discovered web development via my job as a tester. I loved working alongside developers and learning how websites were built. Learning to write automated tests and see them grow from a side project to an integral part of the development cycle was a great achievement, and made me realise that web development was the path I wanted to take.
          </div>
          <br/>
          <div>I would like to find a role that would challenge me as much as it would teach me and to be part of a small and keen team, where I could continue developing the skills and experience General Assembly has provided me with.

            <div>The game is a version of the reversi game, a strategy game for two players played on a 8 X 8 board. Each player has 32 disks, either red (Desdemona) or black (Othello). The players take turns to place on the board. The player can only place a disk on an empty square that will result on an opponent's piece, or a row of opponent's pieces, to be flanked by the players disks. The surrounded pieces are then swapped for the player's disks. The player that first runs out of disks wins.</div>
